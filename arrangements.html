        <div class="rectangle">
        If your arrival is early in the day and you prefer immediate access to your room, we recommend reserving for the prior night to guarantee immediate access. Similarly, for late departures, reserving an additional night will guarantee access until you leave the Resort. If you choose not to reserve, we will be glad to store your bags at the Front Office and make our common area facilities available for you to freshen up.
        </div>
        <h3 style="text-align:center"><em>Guaranteed reservations and deposits</em></h3>
        <div class="rectangle">
        A guaranteed reservation assures you of a room even if you check in late (after 6:00 pm). If a room is not available, we will arrange your accommodation in another hotel at our expense, and provide transportation to and from Eskaya as reasonable. All reservations made must be guaranteed to a major credit card. Certain arrival dates and rates may require a deposit. Please check for full deposit requirements at time of booking.
        </div>
        <h3 style="text-align:center"><em>Cancellation policy</em></h3>
        <div class="rectangle">
        Cancellations for a room reservation must be received 45 days prior to the expected day of arrival, and may differ by arrival date and room type. If cancellation of a guaranteed reservation is not received by the required date, the Resort will charge for accommodation based on the expected date of arrival and room type. For details of cancellation policies and deposit requirements, please check at time of booking.
